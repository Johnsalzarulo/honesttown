# To Do

* Create an error page if no results are found. 
* Create a URL alias system that allows users be able to go to a page as simply as www.honest.town/johnsalzaurlo
* Adjust the "cards" view to make sure that all text fits horizontally on the card. 
* Build out a welcome / marketing page
* Work with the twitter API to be able to tweet from honest.town
* Overall applicaiton flow needs to be improved.

* Get rid of proffessional or "public pages"
* User voting on "specific cards"?? This would help the app decide what people actually agree with.
